					<div class="column content">
						<p>I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at <span id="nu">Northwestern University</span> (NU) in Evanston, IL. My plan is to graduate in 4 years with both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Computer Science.
						<p>A few of my favorite classes that I've taken here include Networking (the computer kind), the introductory Systems course (of which I was a TA), and Public Speaking.</p>
						<p>On campus, I've made an active effort to stay involved with the growing Computer Science community.</p>
						<p>I am the former president of <a href="http://ieee.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">IEEE Northwestern</a>, where I led the planning of numerous events catered toward cultivating a student culture that recognizes those individuals who explore their technical passions outside of the traditional classroom environment.</p>

						<p>This summer (2017), I will be interning for <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> in New York as a Technology Analyst on the Prime Services team.</p>
						<p>This past summer, I was a software engineering intern at <a href="http://www.geaviation.com/">GE Aviation</a>, where I worked on the Vehicle Health and Data Management team.</p>
						<p>I've also interned at <a href="http://www.rawlingsgroup.com/">The Rawlings Group</a>, an insurance subrogation company near my hometown in Kentucky, where I got my first taste of full-stack web development as an Applications Developer for the Audit group.</p>

						<h3><a href="http://paep3nguin.github.io/pitch-perfect-3">Pitch Perfect 3</a></h3>
						<p>I made this web application with two classmates in a course called <a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~pardo/courses/eecs352/">"Machine Perception of Music and Audio."</a></p>
						<p>The site is an ear training tool that allows users to test how well they can recognize and sing musical notes at different pitches. We used a third-party pitch tracking JavaScript library, along with the Materialize CSS library. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/PaeP3nguin/pitch-perfect-3">here</a>.</p>

						<h3><a href="https://the-garage-directory.firebaseapp.com/">The Garage Directory</a></h3>
						<p>The Garage is a fairly new startup incubator for student entrepreneurs at NU. I have a work-study position there, so I'm around the space all the time. Hence, for my very first Firebase web application, I was inspired to create a catalog of the student "residents" who developed their ideas at The Garage.</p>
						<p>While not finished, the project represents an important milestone of firsts for me, from integrating a task runner into my workflow to making API calls to a "backend" like Firebase. Check out the source code and possible future goals <a href="https://github.com/cschen13/garage-directory">here</a>.</p>

						<h3><a href="https://devpost.com/software/chef-curry">Chef Curry</a></h3>
						<p>With two <em>other</em> friends, I made Chef Curry, a web application and Amazon Alexa skill, at BoilerMake, Purdue University's annual 36-hour hackathon. The application lets users track the food inventory they have in their kitchen (with multiple users per kitchen). You can also ask Alexa to add items to your kitchen or give you recipes using the foods you already have.</p>
						<p>In 2017, this project won BoilerMake IV's Best Domain Name award, with "chefcurry.org." You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/philipslan/chef_curry">here</a>, or click the title above for more info on Devpost.</p>

						<h3><a href="http://cschen13.github.io/rha">Northwestern RHA Website</a></h3>
						<p>This project was basically the first website that I ever built and took "seriously." It was intended for a student group that I was involved with called the Residence Hall Association, which needed a newly redesigned website to reflect the organization's recent restructuring.</p>
						<p>My term as Publicity Chair ended before I could finish putting in all of the specific details, but the overall structure of the site is complete. I made heavy use of the Materialize CSS library. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/cschen13/rha">here</a>.</p>
